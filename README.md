# Official Portfolio

## __Overview__
Hello World, my name is Blake Marter.

As a driven and tech-savvy Web Developer, I have always had a strong gravitational pull towards technology. I am currently pursuing an intensive Web Development Coding Certification at the University of Pennsylvania. I am gaining experience in the foundations of web development while honing my skills in HTML5, CCS, Bootstrap, and Javascript, jQuery and a bit of Python & MySQL. Having an appetite for continuous learning, collaboration, and problem-solving, I plan to create and maintain websites, while also developing iOS & Android apps.  Equally passionate about building applications that assist everyday people to make their lives easier. Looking to bring my attention to detail and technical skills to a company to grow and become a valuable asset.

This is my official portfolio. This is a living portfolio and will evolve as I do throughout my career in web development.
